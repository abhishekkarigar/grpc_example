issues when running protoc command

        protoc-gen-go: unable to determine Go import path for "chat.proto"

        Please specify either:
                • a "go_package" option in the .proto source file, or
                • a "M" argument on the command line.

        See https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/go-generated#package for more information.

        --go_out: protoc-gen-go: Plugin failed with status code 1.

above issue got resolved once adding the following line in chat.proto file
option go_package = "chat/";

then re-execute the following command

$ protoc --go_out=plugins=grpc:. chat/chat.proto


Note: chat folder has chat.pb.go which is used for registration in server.go file
      chat.proto is definition which will be shared with the clients unlike rest api where we use json data from client
      chat.go has the definition/implementation to rpc messages
